Areas at risk of biocontamination can be routinely monitored using these methods below, allowing for trend analysis over time and enabling appropriate control measures to be implemented. Contact Plates \\u2013 used to measure microbial contamination of work surfaces. The surface of an agar plate is pressed against a flat sampling surface to pick up any microorganisms that may have settled onto the location by operator contact or from the environment. Settle Plates \\u2013 give an indication of airborne microbial contamination. Agar plates are left, uncovered, for a set period. Any airborne microorganisms that settle onto the surface of the agar plate will grow on incubation and give a representative measure of the microorganisms that may deposit onto surfaces and exposed medical devices within a cleanroom. Active Air Sampling \\u2013 involves extracting a set volume of air within a given environment into a calibrated sampler which is then passed onto the surface on an agar plate. Plates are then incubated to allow the growth of colonies of airborne microbes. Swabs \\u2013 are used on irregular, uneven surfaces where contact plates cannot otherwise be used. Swabs will be wiped over such surfaces and inserted into a vial that preserves the levels of bacteria present, before being returned to the laboratory for analysis. Swabs provide a reliable way of assessing contamination levels.\\n\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n      }\n    },\n    styles: [\"\"]\n  });\n  return EnvironmentalmonitoringComponent;\n})();","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
